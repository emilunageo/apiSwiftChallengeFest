### 2. Push to Git
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Deploy on Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create new project â†’ Deploy from GitHub
3. Select your repository
4. Add environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://swiftChallenge:%2313swiftChallengePass%232025@cluster0.khix41i.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
   JWT_SECRET=70a6632680d41eabf88f48f7a18166c728b927b5b345b222d8813487d4eb71b5815991ef1939d09032391fd579cc526fdd7841a3bf88ca673d6ebef73067510e
